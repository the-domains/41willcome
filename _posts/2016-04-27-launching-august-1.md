God is with you. 

Your story is not over. 

You are not defeated. 

**IN THE BIBLE, IT RAINED FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS.**But day 41 came, and the rain stopped. The people of Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. Then year 41 came, and a new generation entered the Promised Land. For 40 days, Goliath bullied Israel and dared anyone to fight him. Day 41 came, and David slew the giant. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/02502a6d-349c-46c3-8896-b41da41ace8c.jpg)
