God is with you.

Your story is not over.

You are not defeated.

**IN THE BIBLE, IT RAINED FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS.** But day 41 came, and the rain stopped. The people of Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. Then year 41 came, and a new generation entered the Promised Land. For 40 days, Goliath bullied Israel and dared anyone to fight him. Day 41 came, and David slew the giant.

**DO YOU SEE THE THEME? DON'T QUIT. DON'T GIVE UP.**

Perhaps you're stuck in a downpour or lost in one of life's deserts. Maybe you're facing someone or something that could take you down. You might feel stuck on your journey, but your 41 will come--it's on it's way.

A bold declaration of faith, 41 Will Come is a shot of encouragement and hope for everyone in the midst of one of life's battles. No matter how long you've been fighting--days, weeks, or years--debut author Chuck Tate offers you seven keys to help you hang on to the promise that God will come through for you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9d42d29a-0c92-4e98-b477-da1b2ee20292.jpg)
