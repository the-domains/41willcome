God is with you.

Your story is not over.

You are not defeated.

**IN THE BIBLE, IT RAINED FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS.**But day 41 came, and the rain stopped. The people of Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. Then year 41 came, and a new generation entered the Promised Land. For 40 days, Goliath bullied Israel and dared anyone to fight him. Day 41 came, and David slew the giant.
